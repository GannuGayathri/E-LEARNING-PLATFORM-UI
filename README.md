# I created the front-end of an e-learning platform using web technologies, focusing on features like course listing, progress tracking, and video embedding.I used HTML to build the structure of the website, creating different sections such as “Available Courses,” “My Progress,” and “Course Content.” CSS was applied to style the pages, arrange layouts, and make the interface clean and responsive so that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. To add interactivity, I included JavaScript, which helps in showing progress updates, switching between course modules, and embedding videos dynamically.The platform also includes a course listing section where learners can view all available courses with basic details such as title, description, and level. A progress tracking feature allows learners to see how much of a course they have completed, which is important for motivation and self-assessment. The video embedding feature makes it possible to integrate educational videos directly into the platform, allowing learners to watch lessons without leaving the site.I worked on this project using Visual Studio Code as the main editor.VS Code was especially useful because it provides extensions and debugging support that made the development process smoother.This kind of project has wide real-world applications. In the education sector, it can be used by schools, colleges, and training institutes to deliver courses online. In the corporate field, companies can use it for employee training programs or onboarding sessions. It is also highly relevant for self-learning platforms, where users can sign up for courses and learn at their own pace.Working on this project helped me gain hands-on practice with web layouts, responsive design, embedding multimedia content, and basic JavaScript functionalities. I also understood the importance of user experience in educational platforms, where navigation and clarity are very important.building the front-end for an e-learning platform was a great learning experience. It not only improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but also gave me an idea of how digital learning platforms are designed. #
